# CPU_sim
This repository provides a CPU simulation for a ASM language

The CPU simulation is designed to allow emulation of arbitary bit widths and rapid prototyping. In order to do this, some affordances are provided(namely infinite amount of memory addresses and infinite arbitary registers each with a unique name up to the limits of the simulator)
