# CPU_sim
This repository provides a CPU simulation for a ASM language

The CPU simulation is designed to allow emulation of arbitary bit widths and rapid prototyping. In order to do this, some affordances are provided(namely infinite amount of memory addresses and infinite arbitary registers each with a unique name up to the limits of the simulator)

To use the code in this repository, just make sure that both the CPU_core.py and CPU_ASM_parser.py files are available for both ASM_parser_interactive_testing.py and CPU_ASM_runner.py . No additional dependencies are needed(except for python). Both programs are ideally ran in an command prompt.

If you have any issues, bugs, or ideas on how to improve this repository, feel free to create an issue.
